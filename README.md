## Titanic Project

This is a data analysis and machine learning project based on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore the data, clean it, visualize key insights, and build a predictive model to determine passenger survival.

The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Passenger class
- Fare
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Number of parents/children aboard
- Embarked location
- Survival status


Steps Covered

1. *Data Cleaning*  
   - Handling missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Cabin`)
   - Converting categorical variables
   - Dropping irrelevant columns

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
   - Survival rate by gender, class, age group
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Distribution plots

3. *Feature Engineering*  
   - Creating new features (e.g., `FamilySize`, `IsAlone`)
   - Encoding categorical variables

4. *Modeling*  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - Cross-validation and accuracy scoring

5. *Evaluation*  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Classification report  
   - ROC curve


Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub


Goal

To practice real-world data science workflow and build a predictive model for Titanic survival using clean and interpretable code.
